# JW Footwear
JW Footwear is a demonstration e-commerce application that sells shoes.  I made it for the purpose of learning web development.  It allows users to add shoes of various sizes to their cart, place orders, view their order history, and leave reviews and ratings on products they've purchased.  This repo is the backend of the JW Footwear project.
